/*to pick back up where oyu left off after your html is done we are going to add an
 animated school packground to the design or mayble an old school desk design so that 
 it looks like youre taking a test when you were a kid and then the grading pop up window 
 will give you letter grade in that clasic red pen/marker and then the end user can try againn
 for a better score or try a different exam 
 
 cherry on top/ice box after you get the test working/ mvp itd be cool i f you could turn the cursor into a number 2 pencil
 and the instead of the buttons being the answer we could have the user click the letter A,B,C,D and the clicked one
 gets a "hand drawn circle i think thatd make the nostalgic quiz vibe go over the top."
 
 */

 /* for the exam im thingking 3 difficulties one simple like animal facts , a medium onw like country capitals
 and then the hardest one could be a coding one or something like that way when the project is over i can turn the 
 hard one into a quiz for nani to study for his GC license exam*/
